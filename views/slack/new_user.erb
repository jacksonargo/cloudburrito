Welcome to the Cloud Burrito, where all your delicious dreams come true!
Now that you're here, you'll need to know how this works.
To join the Cloud Burrito type:
>/cloudburrito join
Once you are in the Cloud Burrito you will need to wait an hour before you can request a burrito, which you can do by typing in the following:
>/cloudburrito feed
A random person in the Cloud Burrito pool party will be selected to bring you a burrito, once you have received the burrito, you must acknowledge by typing in the following:
>/cloudburrito full
If you receive a request to bring someone a burrito you will need to acknowledge by typing:
>/cloudburrito serving
If you need a reminder of these commands, just type in:
>/cloudburrito
And that's it! Have fun!
